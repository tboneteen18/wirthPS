        Personalized Breast Care: Guide to Cosmetic Surgery,
        Breast Cancer and Reconstruction is a straightforward guide to breast health.
        The editors, Dr. Garrett A. Wirth, Dr. Karen T. Lane, and Dr. Keyian Z.
        Paydar found a balance between a complete medical textbook and a basic understanding
        of breast care to create this easy- to-read and comprehensive guide.
      </p>
      <p>
        The authors understand that not all areas of the book will apply to everyone.
        The goal is to provide information for all concerned with breast health.
        Read the chapters that are of most interest to you, and reference the rest as you wish.
        The second chapter is full of medical lingo and can be used as a direct
        reference rather than read straight through.
      </p>
      <p>
        The aim of this guide is to help any individual navigate through the healthcare system
        as they go through breast cancer and surgery. The amount of information available to you is overwhelming,
        so this book is a condensed and comprehensive collection of everything you’d need to know.

        I bought Personalized Breast Care for my sister since she just got diagnosed with breast cancer. I reviewed the book before giving it to her to make sure it is what I wanted for her. This book is amazing! I know it will help me get her through this better, and I know it will help her as well. This is a must read!

        Since I have had 2 kids my breast are not and will not ever be the same. I have been talking to my hubby about getting them a mommy make over and he supports me on it. He bought me this so I can understand everything that has to go with getting a boob job. I feel like I can make a better decision on this and how to take care of myself before and after surgery!

        Women are so important and this book focuses on that. It is a good read and perfect for the breast cancer survivor. It goes through the steps of reconstruction of the breast after breast cancer and how to keep and maintain healthy breast at all stages of life. Great book to have and keep on hand for doctor visits too so that you can have a good quality discussion with your doctor about breast health.

        I've been studying breast cancer and all of the treatments and side effects and I found this little book to be very interesting. Never having had cancer I wanted to understand it more from a patients perspective and really dive into what can be done when you are given a life threatening diagnosis. I like that this was a positive and uplifting book that was straightforward and could be helpful to anyone dealing with breast changes.

        This book is a must have for women who are considering any type of breast surgery. There is fantastic information for cosmetic breast surgery such as breast augmentation with implants, breast lift, etc. Also, there is great information for women about breast cancer and reconstruction options. This is an outstanding guide that will help women and their family members navigate the system with very clear, well presented, and unbiased information.
